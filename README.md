Projects, Notes, Etc. from Andrew Ng's Deep Learning Course on Coursera

The general structure of this will be broken down into two folders:

1) Notes
    These are the general takeaways to refer back to. These won't be comprehensive but will rather be a fairly high level overview
    of the material or points I found particular poignant
2) Projects
    As the name suggests, this will house the projects and general coding assignments undertaken during the duration of the course

Updates:

1. 7/7/2025: First day of the course. Went over the first week of content including the general setup of the course as well as an overview
of what neural networks are
